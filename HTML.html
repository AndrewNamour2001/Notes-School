A Markup language is a computer language that defines the structure and presentation of raw text. Markup languages work by surrounding raw text with information the computer can interpret, "marking it up" to be processed.
In HTML, the computer can interpret raw text that is wrapped in HTML elements. These elements are often nested inside one another, with each containing information about the type and structure of the information to be displayed in the browser.
HyperText is text displayed on a computer or device that provides access to other text through links, also known as "hyperlinks"
All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>.

The HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>.

Paragraphs (<p>) simply contain a block of plain text.

<div>s can contain any text or other HTML elements. They are primarily used to divide HTML documents into sections.
<span>s contain short pieces of text or other HTML. They are primarily used to wrap small pieces of content that are on the same line as other content and do not break text into different sections.

Headings:
<h1>This is heading 1</h1>  First most important heading
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>  Second most important heading
<h3>This is heading 3</h3>  Third most important heading
<h4>This is heading 4</h4>  Fourth most important heading
<h5>This is heading 5</h5>  Fifth most important heading 
<h6>This is heading 6</h6>  Sixth most important heading
<h1> being the most important heading and <h6> being the least important heading as shown above.

Div headings:
<div style="color:#0000FF"> Choose the colour of your writing
  <h3>This is a heading</h3>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</div>

Body and head tags:
<html>
<head>
<title>Title of the document</title>
</head>

<body>
The content of the document......
</body>

</html>

Line Breaks:
This text contains<br>a line break.

HTML <!--...--> Tag
<!--This is a comment. Comments are not displayed in the browser-->

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

I used 2 web sites which were Code Academy and w3schools.com   
w3schools.com was a website I found while studying and it helps a lot in terms of basic HTML 
  Cascading Style Sheet):
<style> tag:
 If you wanted to style, for example, multiple <h1> elements, you would have to add inline styling to each element manually.
 HTML allows you to write CSS code in its own dedicated section with the <style> element.
 In order to use the <style> element it must be placed inside of the <head> element.
 After adding a <style> tag in the head section, you can begin writing CSS code.
 
 The .css file:
 You can create a CSS file by using the .css file name extension, like so: style.css
 With a CSS file, you can write all the CSS code needed to style a page without sacrificing the readability and maintainability of your HTML file.
 
 Linking the CSS File:
 You can use the <link> element to link HTML and CSS files together. The <link> element must be placed within the head of the HTML file. 
 href — like the anchor element, the value of this attribute must be the address, or path, to the CSS file.
type — this attribute describes the type of document that you are linking to (in this case, a CSS file). The value of this attribute should be set to text/css.
rel — this attribute describes the relationship between the HTML file and the CSS file. Because you are linking to a stylesheet, the value should be set to stylesheet.

Tag Name:
CSS can select HTML elements by using an element's tag name. A tag name is the word (or character) between HTML angle brackets.
For example, in HTML, the tag for a paragraph element is <p>. The CSS syntax for selecting <p> elements is:
Class Name:
CSS is not limited to selecting elements by tag name. HTML elements can have more than just a tag name; they can also have attributes. One common attribute is the class attribute. It's also possible to select an element by its class attribute.
Multiple Classes
We can use CSS to select an HTML element's class attribute by name.

So far, we've selected elements using only one class name per element. If every HTML element had a single class, all the style information for each element would require a new class.

Luckily, it's possible to add more than one class name to an HTML element's class attribute.

For instance, perhaps there's a heading element that needs to be green and bold. You could write two CSS rules like so:

ID Name
If an HTML element needs to be styled uniquely (no matter what classes are applied to the element), we can add an ID to the element. To add an ID to an element, the element needs an id attribute
Classes and IDs
CSS can select HTML elements by their tag, class, and ID. CSS classes and IDs have different purposes, which can affect which one you use to style HTML elements.
Specificity
Specificity is the order by which the browser decides which CSS styles will be displayed. A best practice in CSS is to style elements while using the lowest degree of specificity, so that if an element needs a new style, it is easy to override.
Chaining Selectors
When writing CSS rules, it's possible to require an HTML element to have two or more CSS selectors at the same time.

This is done by combining multiple selectors, which we will refer to as chaining.
Nested Elements
In addition to chaining selectors to select elements, CSS also supports selecting elements that are nested within other HTML elements. For instance, consider the following HTML:
Chaining and Specificity
In the last exercise, instead of selecting all h5 elements, you selected only the h5 elements nested inside the .description elements. This CSS selector was more specific than writing only h5. Adding more than one tag, class, or ID to a CSS selector increases the specificity of the CSS selector.
Important
There is one thing that is even more specific than IDs: !important. !important can be applied to specific attributes instead of full rules. It will override any style no matter how specific it is. As a result, it should almost never be used. Once !important is used, it is very hard to override.
Multiple Selectors
In order to make CSS more concise, it's possible to add CSS styles to multiple CSS selectors all at once. This prevents writing repetitive code.
Review CSS Selectors
Throughout this lesson, you learned how to select HTML elements with CSS and apply styles to them. Let's review what you learned:

CSS can change the look of HTML elements. In order to do this, CSS must select HTML elements, then apply styles to them.
CSS can select HTML elements by tag, class, or ID.
Multiple CSS classes can be applied to one HTML element.
Classes can be reusable, while IDs can only be used once.
IDs are more specific than classes, and classes are more specific than tags. That means IDs will override any styles from a class, and classes will override any styles from a tag selector.
Multiple selectors can be chained together to select an element. This raises the specificity, but can be necessary.
Nested elements can be selected by separating selectors with a space.
The !important flag will override any style, however it should almost never be used, as it is extremely difficult to override.
Multiple unrelated selectors can receive the same styles by separating the selector names with commas.
Great work this lesson. With this knowledge, you'll be able to use CSS to change the look and feel of websites to make them look great.
Font Weight
In CSS, the font-weight property controls how bold or thin text appears.
Text Align
No matter how much styling is applied to text (typeface, size, weight, etc.), text always appears on the left side of the browser.
left — aligns text to the left hand side of its parent element, which in this case is the browser.
center — centers text inside of its parent element.
right — aligns text to the right hand side of its parent element.
Color
Before discussing the specifics of color, it's important to make two distinctions about color. Color can affect the following design aspects:

Foreground color
Background color
Foreground color is the color that an element appears in. For example, when a heading is styled to appear green, the foreground color of the heading has been styled.

Conversely, when a heading is styled so that its background appears yellow, the background color of the heading has been styled.
Opacity
Opacity is the measure of how transparent an element is. It's measured from 0 to 1, with 1 representing 100%, or fully visible and opaque, and 0 representing 0%, or fully invisible.
