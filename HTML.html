A Markup language is a computer language that defines the structure and presentation of raw text. Markup languages work by surrounding raw text with information the computer can interpret, "marking it up" to be processed.
In HTML, the computer can interpret raw text that is wrapped in HTML elements. These elements are often nested inside one another, with each containing information about the type and structure of the information to be displayed in the browser.
HyperText is text displayed on a computer or device that provides access to other text through links, also known as "hyperlinks"

Paragraphs (<p>) simply contain a block of plain text.
<div>s can contain any text or other HTML elements. They are primarily used to divide HTML documents into sections.
<span>s contain short pieces of text or other HTML. They are primarily used to wrap small pieces of content that are on the same line as other content and do not break text into different sections.
