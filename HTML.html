A Markup language is a computer language that defines the structure and presentation of raw text. Markup languages work by surrounding raw text with information the computer can interpret, "marking it up" to be processed.
In HTML, the computer can interpret raw text that is wrapped in HTML elements. These elements are often nested inside one another, with each containing information about the type and structure of the information to be displayed in the browser.
HyperText is text displayed on a computer or device that provides access to other text through links, also known as "hyperlinks"
All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>.

The HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>.

Paragraphs (<p>) simply contain a block of plain text.

<div>s can contain any text or other HTML elements. They are primarily used to divide HTML documents into sections.
<span>s contain short pieces of text or other HTML. They are primarily used to wrap small pieces of content that are on the same line as other content and do not break text into different sections.

Headings:
<h1>This is heading 1</h1>  First most important heading
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>  Second most important heading
<h3>This is heading 3</h3>  Third most important heading
<h4>This is heading 4</h4>  Fourth most important heading
<h5>This is heading 5</h5>  Fifth most important heading 
<h6>This is heading 6</h6>  Sixth most important heading
<h1> being the most important heading and <h6> being the least important heading as shown above.

Div headings:
<div style="color:#0000FF"> Choose the colour of your writing
  <h3>This is a heading</h3>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</div>

I used 2 web sites which were Code Academy and w3schools.com   
w3schools.com was a website I found while studying and it helps a lot in terms of basic HTML 
  Cascading Style Sheet):
<style> tag:
 If you wanted to style, for example, multiple <h1> elements, you would have to add inline styling to each element manually.
 HTML allows you to write CSS code in its own dedicated section with the <style> element.
 In order to use the <style> element it must be placed inside of the <head> element.
 After adding a <style> tag in the head section, you can begin writing CSS code.
 
 The .css file:
 You can create a CSS file by using the .css file name extension, like so: style.css
 With a CSS file, you can write all the CSS code needed to style a page without sacrificing the readability and maintainability of your HTML file.
 
 Linking the CSS File:
 You can use the <link> element to link HTML and CSS files together. The <link> element must be placed within the head of the HTML file. 
 href — like the anchor element, the value of this attribute must be the address, or path, to the CSS file.
type — this attribute describes the type of document that you are linking to (in this case, a CSS file). The value of this attribute should be set to text/css.
rel — this attribute describes the relationship between the HTML file and the CSS file. Because you are linking to a stylesheet, the value should be set to stylesheet.
