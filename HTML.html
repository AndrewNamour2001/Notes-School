A Markup language is a computer language that defines the structure and presentation of raw text. Markup languages work by surrounding raw text with information the computer can interpret, "marking it up" to be processed.
In HTML, the computer can interpret raw text that is wrapped in HTML elements. These elements are often nested inside one another, with each containing information about the type and structure of the information to be displayed in the browser.
HyperText is text displayed on a computer or device that provides access to other text through links, also known as "hyperlinks"
All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>.

The HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>.

Paragraphs (<p>) simply contain a block of plain text.

<div>s can contain any text or other HTML elements. They are primarily used to divide HTML documents into sections.
<span>s contain short pieces of text or other HTML. They are primarily used to wrap small pieces of content that are on the same line as other content and do not break text into different sections.

Headings:
<h1>This is heading 1</h1>  First most important heading
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>  Second most important heading
<h3>This is heading 3</h3>  Third most important heading
<h4>This is heading 4</h4>  Fourth most important heading
<h5>This is heading 5</h5>  Fifth most important heading 
<h6>This is heading 6</h6>  Sixth most important heading
<h1> being the most important heading and <h6> being the least important heading as shown above.
